StrathE2E contains 3 ocean volumes. There's an inshore-offshore divide, and a shallow-deep divide. Only the offshore volume is split into shallow and deep. Choosing a shallow-deep boundary depth has knock-on consequences for the inshore-offshore divide, as the inshore zone will be defined as the sea surface to this depth. StrathE2E assumes that the volumes are well mixed, and any exchange between the deep and shallow compartments are controlled by vertical diffusivity at that depth. The boundary depth therefore needs to be deep enough to avoid excessive mixing between the volumes, while also considering how large the inshore zone will end up being. The spatial arrangement of StratheE2E is shown below.

**Following our first case study meeting 70 m was suggested to separate the shallow and deep layers based on the euphotic layer depth (https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-2020-25) for Mauritania-Senegal. We have done the same here for consistency. **

As well as the vertical boundary depth, We need to choose the horizontal extent for the inshore and offshore zones of the model domain. When doing this we need to consider the following: 

* The offshore zone should extend to the continental slope. 
* Fishing activity is often high along the shelf edge, so this activity should be within in the model domain. 
* The depth limits for the inshore zone will be 0 and the minimum depth for the offshore zone.
* The inshore zone must be an area large enough to sample NEMO-MEDUSA model outputs.

In StrathE2E terrestrial inputs can only reach the offshore zone by transiting through the inshore zone. In areas with very steep bathymetry it is possible the offshore zone polygons created above could contact land. We therefore also need to set a minimum distance from shore for the offshore zone. This ensures the inshore zone exists all along the coast. In practice this distance needs to allow a pixel of NEMO-MEDUSA model output to sit between the coast and offshore zone polygon. We chose a minimum distance from shore for the offshore zone of 20 km.

**Following our first case study meeting a 900 m maximum depth for the offshore zone was suggested. This is the maximum depth which hake trawlers operate to for Senegal-Mauritania. We have kept this consistent for the Western Sahara. **

Finally we need to "cut" the polygons defined by depths and distances from shore so that they don't extend around the whole world. Our first suggestion is to use the EEZ for the Western Sahara, to avoid overlap with the other implementations. If you would rather cut at Cape Bojador we can do that too.

This results in the following:

```{r domain, eval = T}

colours <- c(Inshore = "yellow", Offshore = "yellow3")

 GEBCO <- read_stars("../Shared data/GEBCO_2020.nc", proxy = TRUE)
 st_crs(GEBCO) <- 4326

 crop <- domain %>% 
   st_buffer(40000) %>% 
   st_transform(4326) %>% 
   st_bbox()
 
 GEBCO <- GEBCO[crop] %>%
   st_transform(crs) %>%
   st_as_stars(downsample = 3)

land <- units::set_units(0, "m")

GEBCO[[1]][GEBCO[[1]] >= land] <- NA

Cape <- st_linestring(matrix(c(-14, -20, 26.1, 26.1), ncol = 2, byrow = FALSE)) %>% 
  st_sfc() %>% 
  st_as_sf(label = "Cape Bojador", crs = 4326)

ggplot() +
  geom_sf(data = world, size = 0.1, fill = "black") +
  geom_stars(data = GEBCO) +
  viridis::scale_fill_viridis(name = "Elevation", option = "turbo") +
  ggnewscale::new_scale_fill() +
  geom_sf(data = domain, aes(fill = Shore), colour = "black", size = 0.1) +
  geom_sf(data = Cape, colour = "black") +
  scale_fill_manual(values = colours, name = "Zone") +
  coord_sf(xlim = st_bbox(domain)[c(1,3)], ylim = st_bbox(domain)[c(2,4)]) + # Specify the plotting window for SF maps   theme_minimal() +
  labs(caption = "Suggested model area") +
  NULL
```

The polygons for the inshore and offshore zones are shown in yellows. The bathymetry is plotted underneath in a rainbow palette, so you can see how the shelf extends beyond where we cut the domain. The horizontal black line indicates where the model domain would stop if you restricted to south of Cape Bojador. 

To check how the proposed model domain relates to fishing activity, we plotted the cumulative fishing effort according to global fishing watch from 2017 - 2020:

``` {r fishing, eval = T}

GFW <- readRDS("./Notes/Cache/domain_GFW.rds") %>% 
  st_transform(crs = crs)

ggplot() +
  geom_sf(data = world, size = 0.1, fill = "grey30", colour = "white", size = 0.1) +
  geom_sf(data = domain, fill = "grey", colour = "black", size = 0.1) +
  geom_stars(data = GFW, colour = NA) +
  geom_sf(data = domain, fill = NA, colour = "white", size = 0.2) +
  geom_sf(data = Cape, colour = "grey30") +
  viridis::scale_fill_viridis(na.value = NA, trans = "log10", option = "inferno") +
  coord_sf(xlim = st_bbox(domain)[c(1,3)], ylim = st_bbox(domain)[c(2,4)]) + # Specify the plotting window for SF maps in this region
  theme_minimal() +
  labs(caption = "Total fishing effort") +
  NULL

```

The model domain is shown in grey with white borders, while the fishing effort is shown as a heatmap on a log scale. The 900m depth contour does seem to capture the bulk of the fishing activity. There does seem to be a step change in fishing activity at Cape Bojador.
